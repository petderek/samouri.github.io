### shit views to conquer

- **behavioral interviews are idiotic**: "why do you want to work here", "what do you hope to gain from this experience", "what makes you think you are a good fit", "how did you get started with X".  Every time I hear one of these I freeze. Internally I think about how cliche it is. About how the company/project/job/event/whatever isn't some special unique snowflake, I clearly want to join because of the merits of the program as listed on their website.  Someone could have memorized and rehearsed the answers. Hell, usually places even have a section of their site specifically saying what they are looking for.  **counter:** the questions may seem clichè, but answers are more varied than you realize.  we are all so used to ourselves that we forget we are very different from others.  you may be tired and bored with your own life story but the interviewer isn't.  Your answers demonstrate a lot of things.  If you memorized answers and rehearsed them it means you care.  If you are genuine it means you are a good fit. If you specifically mention the things they are looking for then it means you did your research.

- **sales is evil**: this is only true in its worst incarnation. at its best they can be a conversation where you help a company solve a problem (assuming you have something real).  [fogcreek on sales](https://www.fogcreek.com/guide/The-most-basic-things-your-company-needs-to-know-about-sales.pdf).
- **my life is clichè**: we are all bored with our own life story.  its less cliche than you think and will only be that way if you hang out in homogenous groups.
- **extraversions is well practiced fakeness**
