### Interest and Debt 

**compound interest**: when you calculate interest by taking the initial amount (principal) and _also include_ the previously accumulated interest.  the general equation for figuring out how much money you'll have with interest that compounds annually and by starting out with a given interest rate, principal, and *n* number of years is:
$$
monies = principal * (interest) ^n
$$
Lets say you wanted to figure out how many years it would take to _double_ your principal. Moving around a few numbers would yield:
$$
years = \log_{interest} 2
$$

**rule of 72**: this is a heuristic to figure out how long it takes to double your money. the rule is that if you take 72 and divide it by your interest percentage, then you'll get pretty damn close to how long it takes to double it.  for example: at 6% it'll take 72/6 which gives us 12 years. The actual answer is 11.9.  Not bad!  

**simple interest**: opposite of compounding interest. every time unit you keep calculating the interest based off of the original principal instead of the accumulation of principal and interest. The formula would be:
$$
total = principal*( 1 + rate*time)
$$
