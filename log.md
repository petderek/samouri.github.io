**Learning**

**what is a money**<br>
when it comes to money, i've always semi-intentionally had my head stuck in the sand.
this bites me in the ass every time i see a car commercial with the words "APR", and with how i continue to leave all my money in a savings account, and especially with my unconscionably blank stare after someone says a term like "mortgage backed security".

thanks to all my newfound free time and khanacademy, its finally time to learn up. <br>
yes, i'll be taking [notes](/finance-notes)

**what is a compiler**
- [x] [super tiny compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler): 200 line compiler that demonstrates all of the steps that a standard compiler undertakes. First is lexing which has two stages: lexical analysis (via a lexer or tokenizer) and syntactic analysis which converts the tokens into an ast. transformation from ast into something is done via a _transformation_ step which almost always involves somehow "traversing" the tree via the visitor pattern.  the final step after transformation is then code generation (printing it back out).

**30 days of JS**

I've heard Wes Bos has a great tutorial called "[Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/)" where you complete 30 little projects in 30 days.  I'm going to give it a go since while I know both es6 and react, I never learned DOM apis. Also lets see if I can do it in 5 days.
